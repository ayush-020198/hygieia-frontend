## Usage
This highly advanced webapp is used to provide the medical organization and patients with electronic health records.

This front-end side uses several tools to make the development easier.

Some of the tools used are react-dropzone, react-hook-form, ipfs, and many more.

You can get a better idea of their integration in your webapps from here. \
